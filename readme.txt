Nord Manager (tool for nordvpn)

===================================================================

- What is it :
This is a simple button to switch ON and OFF nordvpn by clicking on
 the icon (category "internet" in the gnome menu). You can pin it 
on your dashboard if you want.

It works great with the applet "VPN Guetteur"

===================================================================

- To install :
./install.sh

enter your personal code, and then it works.

====================================================================

- Settings :
In the directory ~/.local/share/NordManager you will find a file
named "vpn_command.txt", it contains the default nordvpn command :

nordvpn c us

(Wich means "connection in USA")

Change it to the command adapted to your own needs.

don't forget to RTFM : man nordvpn

;)
